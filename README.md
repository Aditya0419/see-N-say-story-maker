See 'N Say Story Maker

The See 'N Say Story Maker is a fun and interactive web application that allows users to create unique and imaginative stories by combining random words from different categories. Inspired by the classic See 'N Say toy, this project brings a modern twist to storytelling and wordplay.

Features:
- Five buttons representing different word categories: nouns, verbs, adjectives, second nouns, and places.
- Clicking each button generates a random word from its respective category.
- The selected words are displayed in real-time, forming a sentence in the phrase output section.
- Users can click the "Speak" button to have the generated phrase spoken aloud using text-to-speech technology.
- A "Reset" button is available to clear the generated phrase and start fresh.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it accessible and easy to use in any modern web browser. It offers a fun and engaging way to boost creativity, storytelling skills, and have a good laugh with friends.
